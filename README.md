# Promoting Sustainable Water Practices: Clustering Across Counties and States
##### _by: Bob Adams, Farah Malik, Bryan Ortiz, Andrew Seefeldt, and Jennafer Schweyen_
---

# Problem Statement
Climate change has emerged as a pressing global challenge, with significant implications for water resources. As temperatures rise and climates become increasingly erratic and unpredictable, the task of monitoring and managing water usage grows more complex. By leveraging machine learning, we can unlock valuable insights in relation to water consumption patterns that empower policymakers, water resource managers, and communities to make informed decisions, develop adaptation strategies, and implement proactive measures to sustainably manage our water resources in the face of an uncertain climate future.

The objective of this project is to use machine learning to build a clustering model to better understand, and be able to compare and contrast, state-county level water supply and consumption. By providing locally-relevant information, consumers of this information might better understand their own water consumption, identifying areas for improvement and efficiency, and industries in their local area may adjust consumption patterns through awareness and advocacy.

# Data Dictionary and Data Preparation

This analysis required various amounts of data, including that on geographical counties, water usage, median income, temperature, and drought. Data was sourced from a variety of inputs, such as the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Circular reports, the National Weather Service, Nature.com, and the National Drought Mitigation Center. Further information on data acquisition, ingestion, and cleaning/preparation steps can be found in subsequent subsections.

All analysis and data preparation were done in Python or Google Colaboratory, using the following softwares: ```pandas```, ```numpy```, ```matplotlib.pyplot```, ```seaborn```, ```sklearn```, ```scipy```, and ```statsmodels```. Additionally, interactive applications/visualizations were done in Tableau Desktop and Streamlit.


### Geographical Data

#### Input Data:
* Data Source: [National Weather Service](https://www.weather.gov/gis/Counties) (NWS). Counties of the U.S used by NWS to issue county based forecasts and warnings.

|Feature|Type|Description|
|---|-----|----------------------------------------------------|
|lon|float|Longitude; Angular distance of the county west of the meridian.|
|lat|float|Latitude; Angular distance of the county north of the equator.|

#### Data Preparation Steps:
1. Columns present in other data frames were dropped: state and county name.
2. Irrelevant columns were dropped: cwa, time zone, and fe area.

### Estimated Water Usage Data

#### Input Data:
* Data Source: [United States Geological Survey Maryland, Delaware, and the District of Columbia Water Science Center - Public Data Releases](https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/get/5af3311be4b0da30c1b245d8). Direct download [here](https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/get/5af3311be4b0da30c1b245d8#:~:text=officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet-,usco2015v2.0.csv,-%E2%80%9CAll%20Data%20CSV).

#### Data Preparation Steps:
1. The following columns were removed: year, state, and county name.
2. FIPS code column names were standardized to just 'fips'.  
3. All values of '--', were changed to 0, as this was determined to be the case where the information was not provided by the county or sourced by the U.S.G.S.  
4. For any value that was based on days or supply (e.g., number of days or gallons per day), NaN values were adjusted to 0. It is likely these values were 0 if they were not given by the counties.  
5. Averages were used in place of NaN for values that were population or temperature based.

#### Data Preparation:
1. Dropped State, County columns - these were handled centrally
2. Dropped ValidStart, ValidEnd columns - these were all 7 day look forward periods (ex. in X county, 5% of the population was in D0 (abnormally dry) conditions between January 31st 2023 and February 6th, 2023)
3. Dropped StatisticFormatID column - all columns were in the same format (percent of population in each condition per county per reporting period)
4. Renamed Columns None, D0, D1, D2, D3, D4 to match the definitions in the above table - this helped make any outputs in modeling more interpretable.
5. Resampled at an annual basis for each FIPS (county), using mean values (e.g., in 2014, 5% of the population of X was in drought, on average.)
6. Resampled at a monthly basis for each FIPS (county), using mean values.  This enables more detailed visualizatons and time series investigations.

# Executive Summary

## Background and Purpose
According to the United Nations, climate change is primarily a water crisis – whether it be unpredictable rainfall patterns, shrinking ice fields, worsening floods, rising sea levels, wildfires, or droughts, the impact of climate change are complexly linked to water (_[1](https://www.unwater.org/water-facts/water-and-climate-change)_). Climate change has also inevitably resulted in a stress on water resources, such that where, when, and how much water is available to users is becoming less secure (_[2](https://ecology.wa.gov/Air-Climate/Responding-to-climate-change/Water-supply-impacts)_). A reliable supply of water is vital to communities, businesses, the environment, and overall quality of life. Key water solutions which can help ameliorate the impacts of climate change include improved water management and climate-smart agriculture techniques which promote means of using water more efficient to help reduce demand on freshwater supplies (_[3](https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/science/climate-issues/water?gclid=CjwKCAjw44mlBhAQEiwAqP3eVuRMwE59ML1ee51xt7EENlZ6kEIyNP3ffbJAEAYoe8n-UfEZbVC2MBoCVVMQAvD_BwE)_). Sustainable water management is central to building the resilience of societies and it is imperative that action is taken at the state, county, and individual levels. Awareness of water consumption and identification of patterns are effective ways to initiate and facilitate change.

Our project will investigate water consumption patterns across different counties within the contiguous United States. Users of our model will be able to identify metrics around their usage and take actionable measures to improve water outcomes, live more sustainable lifestyles, and combat the effect of climate change. We utilize water usage, drought, and income data to identify factors influencing water consumption and to explore variations across different regions. Using clustering techniques, we can identify areas that face challenges in adopting sustainable water practices compared to their neighboring counterparts. The insights gained from this analysis can also facilitate the development of targeted interventions and improvement plans to promote sustainable water management in these areas.

By the end of this project, we will have an enhanced understanding of water consumption patterns which will contribute to sustainable water management practices and provide valuable insights for individuals and stakeholders involved in water resource planning, policy-making, and conservation efforts.

## Methodology and Analysis
To complete this analysis, several KMeans clustering unsupervised models were built with the aim that consumers at the micro-level (i.e., individuals) and macro-level (e.g., policymakers, water resource managers, agricultural authorities, environmental agencies, water conservation groups, etc.) will explore and examine counties of like consumption patterns to their own, and subsequently gauge the feasibility and sustainability of those patterns. DBScan was also tested as an alternative to KMeans that was robust to outliers, but was not further modeled for purposes of computational efficiency and after a predetermination of the desired number of clusters was realized. Multi-year temperature and drought data was also modeled using time-series analysis to gain an understanding of long-term climate patterns, abrupt climate-related events, trends and variability in temperature and drought conditions, and potential insights into future climate scenarios. Our models were operationalized via a Streamlit application and Tableau interactive choropleth.

The high-level process for this analysis is outlined below.

### 1. Data Cleaning

In addition to the data preparation performed on each source dataset (see [Data Dictionary and Data Preparation](#Data-Dictionary-and-Data-Preparation) section), a master dataset was produced with the following key actions:

- All data outside the year 2015 was removed (where direct correlations with water usage data are critical)
- Five source datasets (drought information, temperature information, county information, income information, and the USGS water information) were combined using FIPS code (e.g., state-county code)
- Columns we adjusted to snake-case for ease of use
- Rows with 98% NaN were dropped; these NaN counties were largely made up of Hawaii, Alaska or USA territories. Due to subsequent scarcity of data for these areas, all rows for Alaska, Hawaii, Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico were dropped.

The fully combined and cleaned data consisted of 48 states and DC, as well as 3100+ counties.  

### 2. Data Exploration and Visualization
We began our analysis with a high-level exploration of the combined data file, including describing all numeric variables, visualizing the distribution of water withdrawal and consumption at various levels of granularity (e.g., irrigation [crops vs. golf fields], livestock, aquaculture, mining, thermoelectric [once through vs. recirculating]),and looking at correlations between different temperatures and drought conditions.

<img src ="./code/02_EDA/images/Water_Usage_by_Cat.png">

Following our preliminary investigation, we explored county level correlations in our combined dataset using Shapely files. Each column was mapped individually onto it's own graphic, but no notable insights were observed beyond common knowledge/assumptions. For example, we observed that the North is colder than the South, Napa Valley draws more water for irrigation than most areas, large cities use larger amounts of drinking water, and the southwest have more drought days than the rest of the country.

<img src ="./code/02_EDA/images/median_household_income.png">

### 3. Data Transformation and Modeling
Following our initial EDA and visualization, KMeans clustering was used to explore connections and uncover correlations that are not easily seen in a two-dimensional map. The data was standard scaled and four separate clustering models were developed and tested.

**Driving Insights at the Individual-Level**
* Population vs. Median Income
    * Users can see what cluster they are in for baseline understanding of socioeconomic considerations, water demand, and resource management
* Public Supply Water Withdrawal vs. Public Supply Domestic Use
    * Users can see how much their cluster uses water in their home vs. how much is available

**Driving Insights at Policymaker/Manager-Level** (e.g., water resource managers, agricultural authorities, environmental agencies, water conservation groups, etc.)
* Irrigation Water Amount Withdrawn vs. Wastewater Reclaimed
    * Can be used to understand the efficiency of water use in agriculture. By comparing the amount of water withdrawn for irrigation to the amount of wastewater reclaimed, policymakers and managers can see how much water is being wasted in the agricultural sector
* Total Water Withdrawal vs. Water Withdrawn for Public Supply
    * Can be used to understand the overall demand for water in a region. By comparing the total amount of water withdrawn to the amount of water withdrawn for public supply, policymakers and managers can see how much water is being used by households, businesses, and industries

Several options were tested in terms of identifying the number of clusters. Initially, inertia and silhouette scores guided the outputs, but thereafter, we decided it would be more impactful for eventual users to see how their county compared to only a handful of others. We directed the model to identify 300 clusters (\~10 counties per cluster) and mapped these accordingly to be seen via Streamlit and Tableau. The granularity of county data, however, presented visual issues when mapped to a larger number of clusters, therefore our final models were updated to use only 50 clusters (\~60 counties per cluster). 

#### Time Series
Climate and Drought Condition data were resampled at a monthly scale using mean values.  We used these values to create engaging and informative visualizations for end users to explore selected counties in the context of the state.

##### Filled Area Charts
Area charts depicting monthly temperature ranges (min-mean-max) are provided, annual averages and a fixed annual mean temperature, indexed against the first year in the date range.  This helps keep track of longer term trends.

Drought Conditions are visualized similarly using area charts.  As the drought categories are sequential (Moderate > Severe > Extreme > Exceptional), values are calculated as the percent of population experiencing at least the specified drought condition.  Areas tend to enter and exit drought conditions sequentially.  This method of visualization reduces visual noise while highlighting the 'walks' up and down the drought conditions.

##### Animated Choropleths
Choropleths (national maps, where counties are color coded in accordance with selected data) were created and animated at a monthly scale for Drought (Exceptional, Extreme, Severe, and Moderate) conditions, and 12-month lag temperature change.  

To simplify visualizations and improve loading time performance, geography and climate data are filtered to the relevant state for the user selected county.  This enables users to view changes in temperature and drought conditions in their area and in neighboring counties.

##### Seasonality Decomposition
It can be difficult to isolate long term trends from time series data, especially when seasonality plays such a critical role as in drought and temperature in most counties.  STL Seasonality Decomposition is employed to separate long term trends from seasonal trends.

### 5. Key Findings and Insights 
Our analysis and applications showed that there is widespread variation in water supply and consumption in many different areas (e.g., industrial, livestock, aquaculture, mining, irrigation, thermoelectric), as well as in county-level temperature and drought changes. Our models showed that sufficient similarities exist between counties to enable clustering and categorization of counties. It was seen that insights can be driven where unexpected, for example:
* While livestock, mining, and aquaculture were not among the highest uses of water consumption, comparative to other categories, the consumption in these areas was highly concentrated to a few states/counties. With a targeted approach, these counties may have the opportunity to spearhead improvements in their processes which could lead to substantial improvements.
* There was a slight suggested correlation between water scarcity and higher income states/counties. Is it possible that wealthier areas pull more water to an extent that constructive campaigns or, at least awareness, may empower sustainable lifestyle changes?
* There is a constant presence of outlier counties in all models we developed, namely in counties using high amounts of public supply water for domestic use, and the number of counties not investing more in irrigating with reclaimed wastewaster to conserve stress on limited freshwater resources. These present immediate opportunities proactive engagement and taking meaningful action.

Furthermore, engaging storytelling is possible with publicly available data. By surfacing these insights and trends with individuals and organizations across the U.S. we may be able to shift the conversation around water usage, while considering current climate conditions and trends.
